            <h1>What is a PDF and Why Is It So Popular?</h1>
            <p>
                Created by Adobe in the early 1990s, the Portable Document Format (PDF) has become the de facto standard for sharing documents. But what exactly is it, and why should you use it?
            </p>

            <h2>The Core Idea: A Digital Printout</h2>
            <p>
                The primary goal of a PDF is to preserve a document's formatting. When you create a PDF, you're essentially creating a digital snapshot of your file. Whether it's a resume, a legal contract, or a design portfolio, you can be confident that it will look exactly the same on your screen, a colleague's screen, or a printout, regardless of the software or operating system used.
            </p>
            <p>
                This solves a common problem with other formats, like Word documents, where opening a file on a different computer can lead to messy formatting changes, missing fonts, and shifted images.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Key Benefits of Using the PDF Format</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Universal Compatibility</h3>
            <p>PDFs are an open standard, and free readers are available for every major operating system and device. This universal access ensures anyone can view your document as you intended.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Fixed Formatting and Layout</h3>
            <p>This is the cornerstone of the PDF. Fonts, images, and layout are "locked in," making PDFs ideal for official documents like invoices, resumes, contracts, and academic papers where presentation is critical.</p>

            <h3>3. Security Features</h3>
            <p>
                PDFs offer robust security options. You can restrict printing, copying, or editing. You can also add password protection to control who can open the file.

            </ul>

            <h3>4. File Size Compression</h3>
            <p>
                PDFs can be optimized to reduce their file size without a significant loss in quality. This makes them easy to share via email or download from a website.

            <h2>When to Use PDF?</h2>
            <p>
                PDF is the perfect choice when the final appearance and security of your document matter most.
